# RomCom  

### Abstract:
[//]: <> (Briefly describe what you built and its features. What problem is the app solving? How does this application solve that problem?)
We built a web application that generates custom and random book covers, titles and descriptors according to a users input. The user then has the option of saving, displaying and deleting any cover that was generated or made.

### Installation Instructions:
[//]: <> (What steps does a person have to take to get your app cloned down and running?)
1. fork the repository
2. Clone down your new, forked repo
3. cd into the repository
4. Open it in your text editor
5. View the project in the browser by running open index.html in your terminal
### Preview of App:
[//]: <> (Provide ONE gif or screenshot of your application - choose the "coolest" piece of functionality to show off.)

### Context:
[//]: <> (Give some context for the project here. How long did you have to work on it? How far into the Turing program are you?)
The project was our week 2 partner project in Turing FE program, and our first collabrative project. We were given 5 days to complete the project. In the 5 days we worked on it every day for approx. 4-6 hours a day.

### Learning Goals:
[//]: <> (What were the learning goals of this project? What tech did you work with?)
DOM manipulation, working with HTML and CSS, event listeners, event handlers, classes, for loops, if statements. VS code, Atom, web browser, DEV tools, Zoom, Terminal, GIT and GIThub
### Wins + Challenges:
[//]: <> (What are 2-3 wins you have from this project? What were some challenges you faced - and how did you get over them?)
The first and biggest win was when we finished iteration 0. We did it without help and could actually see results from what we did with the code. The second win was completing all the required iterations. 

The biggest challenge was being able to meet with my partner. My partner on many nights would have to wait until I got my kids to sleep to be able to pair on the project. We outlined the hours that would work best for use according to the DTR questions. We powered through it and my partner and I were flexible. We also were able to work on the project separately at points, but made sure that we both understood the code before making any commits.
