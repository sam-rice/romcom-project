# RomCom  

### Abstract:
[//]: <> (Briefly describe what you built and its features. What problem is the app solving? How does this application solve that problem?)

For this project, we built a web application that generates user-created and random book covers. The user is able to combine an image of their choice with a title and tagline of their choice. The user then has the option of saving, deleting, and using a gallery to display any saved cover that was generated randomly or made by them.

### Installation Instructions:
[//]: <> (What steps does a person have to take to get your app cloned down and running?)

1. Fork this repository.
2. Clone your new, forked repo to your local machine.
3. `cd` into the project's parent-level repository on your local machine.
4. Open all files in your text editor.
5. View the project in the browser by running `open index.html` in your terminal.

### Preview of App:
[//]: <> (Provide ONE gif or screenshot of your application - choose the "coolest" piece of functionality to show off.)

### Context:
[//]: <> (Give some context for the project here. How long did you have to work on it? How far into the Turing program are you?)

This project was our week 2 project for Turing's Front-End software engineering program, and our first collaborative project. Two of us were given approximately 5 days to complete the project. Ultimately, we worked on this project for approximately 4 - 6 hours per day for 4 days.

### Learning Goals:
[//]: <> (What were the learning goals of this project? What tech did you work with?)

- utilizing Object-Oriented Programming and DOM manipulation 
- reading and understanding the behavior of HTML and CSS
- utilizing browser Dev Tools (Google Chrome) to debug/read the DOM
- continuing to solidify understanding of Javascript fundamentals
- building applications collaboratively
- using best practices for Git/GitHub (pull requests, naming conventions, etc.)
- continuting to solidify understanding of software including VS code, Atom, Zoom, Mac's Terminal, GIT, and GitHub

### Wins + Challenges:
[//]: <> (What are 2-3 wins you have from this project? What were some challenges you faced - and how did you get over them?)

- Our first and biggest win was finishing the basic setup our random poster generator and getting random posters to display. Getting a basic handle on how the application would need to be built out down the line, and strategizing about the best way to set things up was a challenge. We ended up talking through different logical approaches and taking our time to choose what we thought would be the best way to begin.

- Another roadblock we encountered came towards the end of the project, when we needed to research new concepts in order to get the "delete cover" function to work. We were tipped off on which lesson to look ahead at, and along with some MDN docs, we were able to find the solution we needed.

- Completing all necessary steps of the project was our other major win!

Jordan Smith: The biggest challenge was being able to meet with my partner. My partner on many nights would have to wait until I got my kids to sleep to be able to pair on the project. We outlined the hours that would work best for us according to the DTR questions. We powered through it and my partner and I were flexible. We also were able to work on the project separately at points, but made sure that we both understood the code before making any commits.

Sam Rice: My biggest personal challenge was in establishing a workflow between using Dev Tools and my text editor. It took a little while to grasp the logic behind what needed to be logged to the console, for example, to check if an expression was doing what I needed it to. Once I got the hang of it, it became an invaluable part of the debugging process.
